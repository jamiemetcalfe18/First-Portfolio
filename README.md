# First-Portfolio
My first portfolio as a web developer! I made sure to practice good accessibilty habits and made an emphasis on a simple, clean design that is mobile friendly! 

## I have used:
+ **HTML5** for markup.
+ Pure **CSS3** for styling. 
+ Bit of **Jquery** to make header animation effects work
+ Bit of **JavaScript** to make a hamburger menu to work on mobile devices, and back to top button! 
+ **Font Awesome** for Icons. 
+ **Unsplash** for Images.
+ **DevIcon** for skill Icons.

## To-Do
+ Make the main page less black
+ Add pages for projects
+ Graphics design page?
